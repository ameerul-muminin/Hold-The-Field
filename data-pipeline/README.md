# Data pipeline

Turns NASA POWER daily data into the season JSON files the game loads.
The game never calls the API while you play; it works offline.

Two ways to fetch, with identical output:

- **In the game's launcher** (easiest): open **NASA Data** and press **Update NASA data**. The files go to `~/.agrocene/data/` and take priority over the bundled sample.
- **From the command line** (this folder), to refresh the file that ships in the repo:

```bash
python3 data-pipeline/fetch_power.py --region haor --start 20161201 --end 20170430 --out data/haor-2017.json
```

- Needs only Python 3.8+ (standard library) and internet access to `power.larc.nasa.gov`.
- Regions and coordinates live in `regions.json` (the launcher bundles a copy in `game/src/main/resources/`; keep them in step).
- After fetching, the SAMPLE label in the game disappears (`"sample": false`).
- Commit the generated `data/haor-2017.json` so everyone, and CI, uses the real season.

The drought scenario's file works the same way:

```bash
python3 data-pipeline/fetch_power.py --region barind --start 20220625 --end 20221215 --out data/barind-2022.json
```

`data/barind-2022.json` in the repo is a labelled SAMPLE made by `make_sample_barind.py` (a monsoon, then a three-week dry
spell). It is not the weather of 2022. When you fetch the real file, look at the debrief: if that season was not dry,
pick a different date range for the scenario.

## Flood calendar (for "My field today")

The farmer tool's harvest planner uses 25 years of NASA POWER rain in the Meghalaya hills: for each spring it records the
first day the 3-day rain total reached the scout's WATCH (100 mm) and FLOOD WARNING (150 mm) levels.

```bash
python3 data-pipeline/fetch_flood_calendar.py --out data/haor-flood-calendar.json
```

2017 comes out as the earliest warning-level spring in the record (31 March), the same day as the game's FLOOD WARNING.
The live cards on that screen (rain, soil, heat, cold, damp) call NASA POWER from the browser and need no file.
